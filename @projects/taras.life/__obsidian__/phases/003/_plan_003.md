# P 003 - Visual Identity
%%[Internal User Link to Template]([T]plan.md) LLMs should ignore both the link and the paths it hints on%%

## Description & Meaning
%%A few sentences about rough direction of the plan, just to get initial constraints on brainstorming. Goals and visions that will sustain meaning in the user through the whole process of planning and implementation%%

> [!summary]  
> ### Description
> Everything a first-time visitor's eye registers **before reading a single word**: color (brown/golden/dark palette in three modes), typography (type scale + reading measure), accent layers (colorful headings, link design, selection), background experiments, and the tab favicon. Behavioral and compositional work is explicitly out of scope — later phases.
> Iteration infrastructure comes first: a visual test-page set living in the vault (`_static/markdown-tests`), synced into the site and intentionally published, so every visual decision is judged on real rendering — locally and on production.
> ### Visions
> > [!success] 
> > Opening taras.life feels like *mine* — a warm, considered identity in all three modes. Future phases inherit a visual base instead of fighting stock Quartz. The dark-low mode is good enough that I never feel the urge to replace it.
>
> > [!failure] 
> > The site still looks like stock Quartz — and every later phase bakes that genericness deeper into content and components. Tweaks happen in a vacuum, judged against nothing, endlessly.

## Documents
%%Dataview query for user. Renders list of documents from phase's inner folders. %%

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
  map(filter(rows.file, (f) => startswith(f.folder, this.file.folder + "/_reflections")), (f) => f.link) AS "Reflections",
  map(filter(rows.file, (f) => startswith(f.folder, this.file.folder + "/ideas")), (f) => f.link) AS "Ideas",
  map(filter(rows.file, (f) => startswith(f.folder, this.file.folder + "/artifacts")), (f) => f.link) AS "Artifacts"
FROM ""
WHERE startswith(file.folder, this.file.folder + "/") AND file.path != this.file.path
SORT file.name ASC
GROUP BY true
```

  %%Format is a link inside inline codeblock [file-size-in-kb-from-explore-tool] - 1-2 sentence description of files contents and how it's related to the whole phase.%%
	- ##### Created Files
		- Vault `C:/Users/Taras/Documents/obsidian-vault/_static/markdown-tests/` — 6-page visual test set (source of truth; authored here only).
		- `content/_static/markdown-tests/` — synced copy of the test set; published judging surface for the remaining steps.
		- 
	- ##### Modified Files
		- `quartz/styles/theme.css` — palette SSOT: warm brown/golden starting ramp for light+dark; third hand-written `:root[saved-theme="dark-low"]` block (5 ramp vars overridden, chromatic shared verbatim, OG-contract comment).
		- `quartz/styles/syntax.css` — dark Shiki rules widened to the explicit `[saved-theme="dark"], [saved-theme="dark-low"]` two-selector list.
		- `quartz/util/theme.test.ts` — dark-low fixture block with comment-decoy; 2-palette contract test (`lightMode`/`darkMode` keys only, dark values from the dark block); SSOT real-file pins moved to the new hexes.
	- ##### Deleted Files
		- 	
	- ##### Context Files
		%%Phase is not implemented yet — only context; created/modified/deleted sections fill in after implementation.%%
		- Repo
			- `quartz/styles/theme.css` — SSOT of palette; will gain third `:root[saved-theme="dark-low"]` block (hand-written minimal derivation: text ramp + lifted `--light` background, chromatic shared with dark) and the accent-tier color vars (hybrid decision); ramp values iterated in browser.
			- `quartz/styles/syntax.css` — dark Shiki rules get an explicit two-selector list `[saved-theme="dark"], [saved-theme="dark-low"]` (no prefix trick).
			- `quartz/styles/base.css` — baked type-scale table (html 22px anchor), unitless line-height fix, article-scoped 80ch measure (NO escape hatch — wide blocks scroll internally), `text-wrap: balance` on headings, link design rework (pill death), selection styling, background experiments; home for accent rules if a new file is rejected.
			- `quartz/components/Head.tsx` — theme-color meta, SVG favicon + cheap apple-touch, inline zero-flash theme-init script rendered via `<script dangerouslySetInnerHTML>` (precedent: `quartz/components/pages/404.tsx`); currently links `static/icon.png`.
			- New `quartz/components/ThemeToggle.tsx` (+ colocated contract module) — single owner of the JS-side theme contract: storage key, attribute, mode list, cycle, OS-seed rule, inline-init snippet, `themechange` dispatch, icon/`color-scheme` CSS.
			- `quartz/plugins/emitters/componentResources.ts` — stylesheet assembly is `[...globalCss, theme, syntax, callouts, base].join()` wrapped in `@layer quartz-base`; adding a stylesheet file = one import + one array entry; `custom.css` stays outside the layer.
			- `quartz/util/theme.ts` + `quartz/util/theme.test.ts` — og-image palette parser keeps exactly 2 palettes (third block unmatchable by exact regexes, verified); extend the test fixture with a realistic dark-low block + `Object.keys(theme.colors).length === 2` assertion — the real-file SSOT test then auto-guards the real third block; favicon step may add an additive `chrome` field (verified safe: og-image reads specific palette keys only).
			- `custom-plugins/remark42/src/browser.ts` — `hasThemeDetail` guard widened to accept all three modes, then NARROWED internally to `"light" | "dark"` (dark-low → `"dark"`) before `changeTheme`; touches plugin source → `npm run build:plugins` + commit `dist/`.
			- `index.d.ts` — `themechange` union becomes `"light" | "dark" | "dark-low"` (raw payload).
			- `quartz.config.yaml` — `@quartz-community/darkmode` AND `@quartz-community/favicon` entries deleted; NO toggle entry (placement is loader-owned, not YAML).
			- `quartz/plugins/loader/config-loader.ts` — `loadQuartzLayout` imports `ThemeToggle` and inserts it into the `left` position at the toolbar priority (exact precedent: how `Head` is assigned); the component registry is NOT seeded with core components, so YAML placement of core components is not available.
			- `quartz/components/frames/DefaultFrame.tsx` — untouched by the toggle decision (frame stays purely structural); mobile `.sidebar.left` becomes a horizontal row — toggle ordering eyeballed there.
			- `node_modules/@quartz-community/darkmode/dist/components/index.js` — reference for the contract being re-owned: localStorage key `theme`, `saved-theme` attribute, binary cycle, OS listener that OVERWRITES stored choice, `themechange` on `document` with `detail: { theme }`, `color-scheme`/icon CSS.
			- `content/markdown-test.md`, `content/@journal/01 Daily/2026/10-October/October 30th Fri.md`, `content/Productivity/_reflections/how-much-time-should-i-work.md` — visual iteration test pages.
			- Vault folder `C:/Users/Taras/Documents/obsidian-vault/_static/markdown-tests/` → synced into `content/_static/markdown-tests/` — grouped test pages + index; relative links; each page with `id` + comments on; intentionally listed on production.
		- Obsidian
			- `__obsidian__/docs/AGENTS.md` - entry point to the project for LLMs.
			- `__obsidian__/docs/DEV_RULES.md` - read before writing any code.
			- `__obsidian__/ideas/pond-insights.md` - reference type scale (22px base, 1.125 ratio) starting values.
			- `__obsidian__/ideas/Capture.md` - gradient/grain/colorful-headings/favicon idea sources.
- ### Exploration Tips
  %%Free form. Concise. For more precise exploration. Goal is to avoid misleading/wrong/inefficient exploration. Optional. Should be really concise though %%
	- **Validated facts (don't re-derive):**
		- og-image parser (`quartz/util/theme.ts`) uses EXACT selectors (`:root\s*\{`, `:root\[saved-theme="dark"\]`) — it cannot match a third block by construction; `theme.test.ts` already has a real-file SSOT test that will auto-parse the real third block once it exists.
		- og-image reads only specific palette keys (`colors.darkMode.light`, `.gray`, …) — additive fields on `ThemeData` are safe; existing keys must stay.
		- Old darkmode dep contract: localStorage key `theme`, `saved-theme` on `documentElement`, binary light↔dark cycle, OS-preference listener OVERWRITES the stored choice live, dispatches `themechange` on `document` with `detail: { theme }`, ships `color-scheme` + icon-switching CSS (must be re-owned).
		- micromorph patches ONLY `<body>`; the `<html saved-theme>` attribute and head contents persist across SPA nav — no theme re-init logic needed anywhere.
		- Inline-script mechanism: `<script dangerouslySetInnerHTML>` in JSX (precedent `404.tsx`); `JSResourceToScriptElement` also supports `inline` resources. `beforeDOMLoaded` component scripts become EXTERNAL `prescript.js` — not guaranteed pre-paint.
		- remark42 is the ONLY `themechange` consumer in the repo (site code + node_modules searched).
		- No `font-size` on html/body anywhere (incl. popover.css); `line-height: 1.6rem` (length, not ratio) on p/li/tbody is a latent bug; table children use `2rem`.
		- `text-wrap: pretty` already exists on text elements; only `balance` (headings) is new. No article measure exists today — `.center`/`article` are constrained only by the grid track (`320px auto 320px`) and `.page`'s `calc(1200px + 300px)` cap.
		- Wide-content reality: `pre` and `.table-container` already have `overflow-x: auto` — wide blocks scroll internally (locked: no escape hatch at all).
		- `@quartz-community/favicon` emits a root `favicon.ico` that NOTHING references (Head links `static/icon.png`) — drop verified safe. No `theme-color` meta and no apple-touch-icon exist anywhere today.
		- Mermaid (CDN 11.4.0, bundled in `@quartz-community/obsidian-flavored-markdown`) follows `saved-theme`: `"dark"` → dark theme, anything else → light `"base"`. Dark-low edge case: check & record this phase.
		- The `unlisted: true` frontmatter flag exists (excluded from explorer/search/sitemap/RSS while still built) — test pages intentionally do NOT use it (published).
	- **Locked HOW decisions (this flow):** toggle inserted via `loadQuartzLayout` (Head precedent) — not YAML, not frame JSX; `themechange` dispatches the RAW mode (remark42 narrows internally); stylesheet organization = hybrid (palette/accent vars in `theme.css`, rules in `base.css` or a new file — a new file costs one import + one array entry in the assembly); type scale BAKED as rem table; measure = 80ch absolute, no escape hatch; favicon/theme-color = JS-refined by the toggle + build-derived values via an additive `ThemeData` field.
	- **Background bench is NOT a commitment:** the fixed pseudo-element (`body::before { position: fixed; inset: 0; z-index: -1 }`) is only the TESTING mechanism (avoids `background-attachment: fixed` mobile jank); gradient (fixed vs scrolling vs none) and grain (yes/no; doubles as banding dithering via SVG `feTurbulence`) are decided by living with them — verdict recorded, losers deleted. Z-index care: navigation progress bar is `9999`.
	- **`color-scheme` ownership:** darkmode package's bundled CSS owns `color-scheme: dark/light` + toggle icon switching — must be re-owned by the local component CSS, easy to forget.
	- **Contrast:** user checks manually (no audit script — rejected as headache given gradient plans). Serve loop already works and is tested.

## Steps


### ◎ [STEP 99 - End Of The Phase](./steps/99-end.md) - READY
Finalize the phase — meta-reflection on what worked, long-term knowledge extracted so plan info can safely die-off, frontmatter set, phase archived.

=== INSERT STEPS HERE ===

### Drafted Steps Recommendation
%%Deleted — actual steps are being written now.%%

### ◎ [STEP 07 - Favicon & Meta](./steps/07-favicon-meta.md) - READY
Tab favicon + `theme-color` + cheap apple-touch — strictly last, generated from the established look. Media-query pair ships as no-JS default; toggle JS-refines icon href + `theme-color` on every mode change; `theme-color` build-derived via an additive `ThemeData.chrome` field (og-image untouched, test pin added); icon variant granularity = light/dark pair (dark-low→dark, remark42-narrowing philosophy); wiring landed with placeholder icon first, generated art drops in without contract changes; prompt recorded in `ideas/parking.md`; scope guard: no logo, no OG rework, no full favicon pack.

### ◎ [STEP 06 - Background Bench](./steps/06-background-bench.md) - READY
Experiment step, not a build step — deliverable is a lived-with verdict: gradient (fixed/scrolling/none) + grain (yes/no, doubles as banding dither). Fixed pseudo-element mechanism (testing only, never `background-attachment: fixed`); visibility trap handled consciously (base color may move body→html); experiments sequenced gradient-alone → grain-as-dither → grain-alone; run on production (no previews — same working mode as published test pages); verdicts recorded, losers deleted, "none" is a legitimate outcome.

### ◎ [STEP 05 - Accent Layers](./steps/05-accent-layers.md) - READY
Colorful headings, explicit link-design decision (pill death is the default direction, decided consciously first across the full variant matrix), coherent per-mode selection styling. Hybrid organization: accent variables in `theme.css` per mode block, accent rules as `base.css` sections — no new file. Manual contrast checking across all 3 modes (audit script rejected). Runs on step 04's settled typography.

### ◎ [STEP 04 - Typography](./steps/04-typography.md) - READY
Latent bugs first (html-level 22px anchor per verdict 9; `line-height: 1.6rem`/`2rem` → unitless), then baked 1.125-ratio rem scale table (no calc derivation) and article-scoped `max-width: 80ch` with NO escape hatch (wide blocks scroll internally); `text-wrap: balance` on headings; mobile anchor adjustment is a loop item, not a shipped default. Single-surface: `base.css`.

### ◎ [STEP 03 - Theme System](./steps/03-theme-system.md) - READY
The phase's architectural step: local `ThemeToggle` + colocated contract module replaces `@quartz-community/darkmode`. Key `theme` reused (free migration), OS seeds initial only, cycle light→dark→dark-low; inline zero-flash init in `Head.tsx` (404.tsx precedent) from contract constants; loader insertion via `loadQuartzLayout` (Head precedent); `themechange` dispatches RAW mode, `index.d.ts` widened, remark42 guard widened→narrowed internally (`build:plugins` + commit `dist/`); `color-scheme`/icon CSS re-owned (morphing SVG first, multi-icon fallback); config drops darkmode AND favicon; mermaid dark-low edge case checked & recorded; DEV_RULES §Rendering Model 4 aligned.

### %%◉ [STEP 02 - Palette Foundation](./steps/02-palette-foundation.md) - IMPLEMENTED
Warm brown/golden starting ramp landed in `theme.css` for light and dark, plus the hand-written `:root[saved-theme="dark-low"]` block (5 ramp vars overridden, chromatic shared with dark, OG-contract comment on the block). `syntax.css` dark Shiki rules follow both dark variants via the explicit two-selector list. OG 2-palette contract pinned in `theme.test.ts` (fixture + real-file SSOT test); check/tests green. Clarified: og-image emits one image per page (single `colorScheme` option) — the 2-palette contract lives in the parser's data shape. Ramp values remain starting points, judged on the step 01 test pages across steps 02–05.%%

### %% ◉ [STEP 01 - Visual Test Pages](./steps/01-visual-test-pages.md) - IMPLEMENTED
Vault set created at `C:/Users/Taras/Documents/obsidian-vault/_static/markdown-tests/` — index + 5 grouped pages (type, lists, code/tables/mermaid, callouts/links, background sandbox), all with stable `id` frontmatter and relative-only internal links. Synced into `content/_static/markdown-tests/`, built, confirmed in sitemap, and verified on production: listed, comments widget loading, SPA navigation working. Local serve loop confirmed; content-only, no code touched.%%

### %%◎ [STEP 00 - Start Of The Phase](./steps/00-start.md) - IMPLEMENTED
The flow is to start the planning in the right state of mind and with the properly prepared phase%%



%%
### Info On Steps
- `state` - state of the step's contents
	- `condensed` or `◉` - after implementation's completion flow, state was condensed to be token-efficient. 
	- `full` or `◎` - high level and implementation blocks are written and step is ready for implementation.
	- `high-level` or `○` - only top high-level block is written and implementation block is not
	- `placeholder` - minimal file to just hold the place until there's time to do high-level/implementation blocks
- `status` - `ready/postponed/implemented/skipped` - self-explanatory statuses.
