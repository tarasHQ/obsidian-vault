# Lists & Indentation

Ordered, unordered, task lists, and the deep indentation this site's real notes rely on. Back to the [index](./index.md).

## Unordered

- Top level item
	- Second level
		- Third level
			- Fourth level
				- Fifth level — the deepest nesting that must stay visually distinct
- Sibling of the top level, to check the return to shallow depth
- An item with `inline code` and **bold** mixed in
- An item with a [relative link](./type.md)

## Ordered

1. First step
	1. A sub-step of the first
		1. Deeper still
	2. Another sub-step
2. Second step
3. Third step, with a paragraph of body text under the marker to check how wrapped lines align with the number:
   This continuation line belongs to the third item and must align with the item's text, not dangle under the marker.

## Task lists

- [x] A completed task
- [ ] An open task
	- [x] A nested completed subtask
	- [ ] A nested open subtask
- [ ] A task with ==highlighted== emphasis on the important word

## Heavy indentation

The dense nesting style the site's real notes use — long time-stamped outlines with sub-bullets several levels deep. If the reading measure or indentation shrinks too aggressively, this is where text turns into a sliver.

- ###### 00:50
	- A thought at the first indent level, wrapped enough times to prove wrapping aligns under the bullet and not under the timestamp heading.
	- A second thought, with a nested reflection inside it:
		- The nested reflection, one level deeper, still legible.
- ###### 23:06
	- Short thought.
- ###### 21:01
	- A long thought that keeps going: when the indented column gets narrow, wrapped lines must not collapse into a vertical ribbon of two-word lines. This is the exact failure mode the 80ch measure exists to prevent, and this block is its stress test.
	- Another bullet at the same level, to compare rhythm between a long and a short entry.

## Structure soup

Deliberately awkward combinations that must not break layout:

- A list item containing a blockquote:
	> The quote inside the list, indented to the item's content.
- A list item containing a code block:
	```css
	.nested-code-in-list { color: inherit; }
	```
- A list item containing a nested list with a task list inside:
	- Nested level
		- [x] Task inside nested list
		- [ ] Another one
