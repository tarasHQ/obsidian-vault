# Refining Reflection

**Why this flow is needed?** 
- To avoid making suboptimal decisions because of the user's inexperience. 
- To go WIDE before going NARROW. So decisions are made based on the full picture. 

**When this flow is expected to run?**
- Invoked manually. When user wants to get big picture and see all possibilities of provided artifacts.

## Rules
- **STAGE AWARENESS** - Every response to the user should have current stage letter, name and substage letter-number at the first line.

## Stages
- ### A - Exploration
	- [ ] **A1** - [USER]
		- Provides LLM with artifacts that set the scope of the attack & discussion. 
		- Artifacts can be anything. Reflections, ideas, plans, implementation steps, etc.
	- [ ] **A2** - [LLM] 
		- LLM starts thorough exploration. 
		- Goal of exploration is to be able to have context for brainstorming of radically different possibilities
- ### B - Brainstorm
	- [ ] **B1** - [LLM] - **Response #1**
		- Writes a temporary file with self-reflective exploration of all high-level possibilities in 
		- Only `write` tool is allowed. 
		- a temporary `.md` file inside `artifacts/refining-possibilities-xxxx`, where last 4 digits are random [a-z0-9] to avoid duplication.
		- Format is nested lists of questions/points/reflections/ideas (no answers/finalizations/recommendations)
	- [ ] **B2** - [LLM] - **Response #2**
		- Only `write` tool is allowed. 
		- Using already created temporary `.md` file `artifacts/refining-possibilities-xxxx` in previous phase
			- Using append functionality of write tool. 
		- LLM writes in that file 5 to 10 **(reasonable, high-level, radical, architectural)** possibilities for improving user's artifacts.
		- Those points may cover categories:
			- Blind Spots
			- Security 
			- Performance 
			- Low Effort - High Reward ideas
			- Proper long-term decisions.
			- Other, not listed and high-impact categories. 
		- **FORMAT of every point**
			- **Name** - `[CATEGORY] Name-of-the-point`
			- **Description** - 1-3 sentences description of the point. 
			- **How To Do This** - 1-3 sentences describing how to do the point. 
			- **Benefit** - a paragraph on how this point is beneficial
			- **Complexity** - a paragraph or less about how complex is this point
			- **Closed Advantageous Doors** - bulleted list of others paths that will get closed/hard to mover/transfer to if this point will be accepted. 
			- **Description In Simpler Terms** - a paragraph of description in simpler terms (non-advanced) about this point. Goal is to preemptively explain it in a bit more easier wording, so user won't get stuck on unknown technicalities. 
- ### C - Further Exploration
	- [ ] **C1** - [LLM] 
		- LLM starts second pass of thorough exploration focused on points it listed in previous stage, to make sure descriptions/solutions/benefits/etc. is accurate. 
		- LLM does it by running multiple `explore` tools in parallel to research/validate/confirm/refine listed points that need additional research
		- **Rules of Execution of the Stage**:
			- Each explore tool call is a new subtask (without referencing older ones)
			- Max amount of parallel tool calls is **5**
			- Each exploration subtask should have evenly divided work. For example, if you have 3 small issues and 1 big one, you may give a big one its own exploration, and for small issues explore all 3 of them in a single subtask. 
			- Follow-ups are allowed. 
- ### D - Listing Findings
	- [ ] **D1** - [LLM] - **Response #1**
		- No writing/editing of files is allowed. 
		- LLM responds to the user with confirmed/validated/refined possibilities for improving user's artifacts.
		- In the same **FORMAT** that initial drafted list was written. 
		- Each point - name, description, how to do this, benefit, complexity, closed advantageous door, description in simpler terms.
		- **CRUCIAL** - it must be a self-contained list without depending on user's knowledge of previously created temporary file and its contents.
	- [ ] **D2** - [LLM] - **Still Response #1**
		- Within the same response LLM writes a template for user response inside markdown codeblock
		- In this template it lists the name of the point and empty bullet point after for user to fill. 
		- Each issue is separated by an empty line.
- ### E - The Discussion
	- [ ] **E1** - [LLM + USER]
		- User will respond for clarification
		- Goal of the discussion is to refine ideas/possibilities/artifacts based on user feedback. 
- ### F - Filling Out the Plan and Drafting the Steps
	- [ ] **F1** - [LLM]
		- LLM fills out the `_plan_xxx.md`'s **exploration section** with concise related links/tips on exploration for future tasks on this plan based on experience with current exploration.
	- [ ] **F2** - [LLM + USER]
		- Through user's approval - LLM updates user's artifacts to be aligned with locked-in decisions/refining from current flow-task. 
- ### The End
